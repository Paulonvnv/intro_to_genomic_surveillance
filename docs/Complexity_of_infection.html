<p>In malaria epidemiology, the term polyclonality represents the
co-occurrence of two or more different parasite clones (e.g.,
haplotypes) within an infected individual. Polyclonality may occur due
to the concurrent transmission of multiple parasite haplotypes from the
same mosquito bite (co-infection) or the acquisition of different
haplotypes through independent bites (super-infection). Both processes
are related to the intensity of transmission. In low transmission
settings, there are few infective bites and therefore little chance for
super-infections or co-infections to occur. Most infections are
therefore monoclonal. On the other hand, when conditions favor an
increase in mosquito prevalence and human-mosquito interaction,
super-infections and co-infections become more likely, generating an
increase in the prevalence of polyclonal infections. Polyclonality rate
is therefore generally considered a positive correlate of malaria
transmission intensity (although other features such as case importation
or relapse behavior in <em>P. vivax</em> may modify this
relationship).</p>
<div id="differentiating-monoclonal-and-polyclonal-infections"
class="section level2">
<h2>Differentiating monoclonal and polyclonal infections</h2>
<p>There are different ways to differentiate between monoclonal and
polyclonal infections and/or define the number of strains present in a
sample. An easy and widely used way to differentiate between monoclonal
and polyclonal infections is based on the number of heterozygous loci
within the sample (<span class="math inline">\(N_{HetLoci}\)</span>),.
By using a pre-defined threshold (e.g., <span
class="math inline">\(N_{HetLoci} \ge 1\)</span>), samples are
classified as polyclonal if they meet or exceed the threshold and
classified as monoclonal if not. That definition is correct when working
with a small number of loci, and <em>de-novo</em> mutations and
genotyping errors are not frequent for those loci. When working with
whole-genome or amplicon sequencing (microhaplotype) information, a
sample can contain some heterozygous loci as a product of the
diversification of the parasite population within the infection
(<em>de-novo</em> mutations that occurs in the human or in the mosquito)
or due to genotyping errors that occurs during amplification steps
(sWGA, PCR1, or PCR2). For this reason, other metrics have been proposed
to infer polyclonality. One simple metric is the fraction of
heterozygous loci per sample (<span
class="math inline">\(p_{Het_{(i)}}\)</span>), defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Frac_HetLoci }(p_{Het_{(i)}}) =
N_{HetLoci_{(i)}} /N_{(i)}\]</span><span
class="math inline">\(N_{HetLoci_{(i)}}\)</span> represents the number
of heterozygous sites for sample <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(N_{(i)}\)</span> represents the total
number of observed sites for sample <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.<br />
<br />
Another metric used to infer polyclonality is the within-host divergence
(<span class="math inline">\(F_{WS_{(i)}}\)</span>) index, defined as
follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[F_{WS_{(i)}} = \displaystyle{\sum_{j =
1}^{n}{(1 - \frac{H_{W_j}}{H_{exp_{(j)}}})}}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H_{W_j}\)</span> represents the
within-host heterozygosity:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H_{W_j} = 1 - \displaystyle{\sum_{a =
1}^{b_j}{(\frac{({rd}_{a}^{j})}{RD_j})^2}}\]</span></p>
<p>Here, for each sample (<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>), <span
class="math inline">\(rd_a^j\)</span> represents the allele <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> observed at locus <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b_j\)</span> represents the total number of
alleles observed at locus <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, and
<span class="math inline">\(RD_j\)</span> represents the total
read-depth observed at locus <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H_{exp_{(j)}}\)</span> is the
within-population heterozygosity for locus <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H_{exp_{(j)}} = 1 -
\displaystyle{\sum{p_j^2}}\]</span></p>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(p_j\)</span> represents the
frequency of each of the alleles observed at locus <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> at the population level.</p>
<p>Another way to distinguish between monoclonal and polyclonal samples
is to directly estimate the number of strains in each sample (i.e.,
define the ‘complexity of the infection’ (COI)). Samples with COI equal
to 1 are monoclonal, and samples with greater values of COI are
polyclonal. The easiest way to define the COI is to assume that it is
equal to the maximum number of alleles (<span
class="math inline">\(\text{max_nAlleles}\)</span>) observed at any of
the loci in the sample. More sophisticated approaches based on Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods also exist to estimate COI from <a
href="https://github.com/EPPIcenter/THEREALMcCOIL">biallelic</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/EPPIcenter/moire">multiallelic</a> loci, but
these methods are not currently incorporated in the workflow.</p>
<p>In the current workflow, the user is able to set their own criteria
to distinguish between monoclonal and polyclonal samples based on the
combination of the metrics mentioned above. These criteria are set via
the parameter <code>poly_formula</code> (default
<code>"poly_formula": "NHetLoci&gt;1"</code>).</p>

<strong>Figure 1:</strong> Distribution of the fraction of heterozygous
loci by sample (fracHetLoci), within-host divergence (Fws), and the
maximum number of alleles found in a sample at any locus. Dotted lines
represent the quantiles defined by the poly_quantile argument in Terra.

<p>All metrics are shown at the sample level in the following table.
Information specifying which loci show heterozygosity in each sample is
also presented.</p>
