<p>Surveillance of polymorphisms or allelic variants associated with
resistance against antimalarials is an important public health
objective. Therefore most amplicon panels include several markers
against genes that have polymorphisms associated with antimalarial
resistance (i.e. AMPLseq includes 9 markers within 5 genes). This
tutorial identifies the different haplotypes of these genes present in
our data set, and we will determine the frequency of each haplotype in
each category of two Variables of interest.</p>

<h1>Drug resistance surveillance</h1>
<p>The AMPLseq panel includes 5 genes (9 markers in total, some genes
are genotyped by more than one marker) that have polymorphisms
associated with antimalarial resistance. In this section we will
identify the different haplotypes of these genes present in our data
set, and we will determine the frequency of each haplotype in each study
area and in each quarter of the year. For this we will use the function
<code>drug_resistant_haplotypes</code> which has 7 arguments. The first
argument is the <code>ampseq_object</code>. The second is a table with
the reference alleles for each gene, and the polymorphisms associated
with resistance. The structure of this table is as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{c|c:c:c} \text{Chromosome}
&amp; \text{Gene_ID} &amp; \text{Description} &amp; \text{Mutation}
&amp; \text{Anotation} \\ \text{Pf3D7_04_v3} &amp; \text{PF3D7_0417200}
&amp; dhfr &amp; \text{N51I} &amp; \text{Pyrimethamine resistance} \\
... \end{array}\]</span></p>
<p>Where the mutation describes the reference amino acid (sensitive to
the drug), the position in the amino acid chain, and finally the amino
acid associated with resistance.</p>
<p>The third and fourth arguments refer to the common name of the gene
(or the name by which it is identified in the <code>markers</code> table
in the <code>ampseq_object</code>) and the gene ID in the gff file of
the referential strain (in this case strain 3D7). The fifth and sixth
arguments are the .gff and .fasta files of the genome of the reference
strain, and the last argument, <code>variables</code>, is a vector that
has the columns of the <code>metadata</code> table that will be used to
define the subpopulations and generate the report graph. For this
particular example we will define as
<code>variables = c('Sample_id', 'Subnational_level2', 'Quarter_of_Collection')</code>,
where <code>Sample_id</code>, is the column that we will use to map the
data, <code>Subnational_level2</code> is the column to define the area
of study, and <code>Quarter_of_Collection</code> defines the time
scale.</p>

<h3>Individual (sample-level) gene genotypes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Plasmodium</em> parasites are haploid during the erythrocytic
stage. However, multiple clone lineages can exist in the same infected
individual. Some genes are amplified by multiple amplicons, making it
hard to determine the haplotype of each individual clone (phasing or
unique combination of alleles across several loci) in polyclonal
infections. As such, in this report, we will use the term
<strong>genotype</strong> to refer to the combination of alleles across
loci in a sample, regardless of their clonal status. We will use the
term <strong>haplotype</strong> to refer to the unique combination of
alleles across loci in a gene for which we will calculate a population
frequency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the cigar format the variant positions are based on the location
of the mutation in the amplified region and not the position in the
coding sequence, so this format does not directly indicate the
consequences of the mutation in terms of amino acid change.</p>
<p>The workflow identifies the location of the mutations in the coding
sequence, and based on that translates the base pair changes into amino
acid changes. The annotation of the nucleotide and amino acid changes is
based on the <a
href="https://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/docs/mut_nom.html">recommendations for
the descriptions of variants from the Human Genome Variation Society</a>
with slight modifications. In the case of amino acid changes, we use the
one letter code because it is shorter to show in tables and figures.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\overbrace{c.\overbrace{152}^{\text{Position in coding
sequence}}\underbrace{A}_{\text{Reference
allele}}&gt;\underbrace{T}_{\text{Observed allele}}}^{\text{Nucleotide
change in coding region}} \equiv
\underbrace{\overbrace{N}^{\text{Reference or Sensitive
allele}}\underbrace{51}_{\text
{Amino acid position}}\overbrace{I}^{\text{Observed
Allele}}}_{\text{Amino acid change}}
\]</span></p>
<p>The scheme above shows the notation for a nucleotide change in the
coding sequence (left) and its equivalent amino acid change (right).</p>
<p>For a nucleotide change, the code starts with a <code>c.</code> which
makes reference to the coding sequence, then the number indicates the
position in the coding sequence of the gene, the first letter represents
the nucleotide in the reference strain, and finally the last letter
represents the observed nucleotide in the sample. If the DNA sequence of
the amplicon is 100% identical to the reference strain then the genotype
is written as follows <code>c.(=)</code>.</p>

<p>In the case of the amino acid change, allele codes are written such
that the letter to the left of the amino acid position represent the
reference strain allele. If the amino acid sequence of the amplicon is
100% identical to the reference strain then the genotype is written as
follows <code>p.(=)</code>.</p>
<p>Information on individual (sample-level) amino acid polymorphism with
respect to the <strong>reference strain</strong> is shown in the next
table for each amplicon:</p>

<p>More often than not, the reference strain allele represents a
drug-sensitive phenotype. However, in some cases the reference strain
allele is itself a resistance-associated allele. In these cases, we
indicate the sensitive allele instead of the reference allele at the
left of the amino acid position in the code. The sensitive and
resistance-associated mutations are taken from the following <a
href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62997#table3">article</a> and
the information is incorporated into the workflow through the
<code>reference_allele</code> table in Terra. We use capital letters to
denote known resistance-associated mutations, and lowercase letters for
mutations not previously reported with respect to the reference strain.
Furthermore, if a sample contains two or more mutations, the haplotype
is determined by arranging the different mutations in ascending order in
relation to the positive DNA strand and the amino acid chain.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\overbrace{\text{c.[47C&gt;T;152A&gt;T]}}^{\text{Nucleotide changes in
coding region}} \equiv \underbrace{\overbrace{a16v}^{\text{Nonsynonymous
polymorphism}\atop\text{with respect to reference
strain}}\underbrace{N51I}_{\text{Known
resistance-associated}\atop\text{mutation}}}_{\text{Amino acid changes}}
\]</span></p>
<p>In the example above, there are two nonsynonymous mutations at
positions 47 and 152 of the DNA coding sequence. The mutation at the
first amino acid position has not been reported as
resistance-associated, while the second one is a known
resistance-associated mutation. If a resistance-associated mutation has
been reported at a specific amino acid position, but we observe a change
in the sample that has not been associated with resistance or not
reported before, the first letter will be in uppercase and the second
one in lowercase (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(N51a\)</span>).</p>
<p>When an amplicon in a sample is heterozygous, then a slash (/) and a
vertical bar (|) are used to separate the alleles in the DNA coding
sequence and in the amino acid chain, respectively. If one gene is
genotyped by two or more amplicons and one of them is heterozygous, the
slash and vertical bar are only applicable to polymorphisms observed in
the heterozygous amplicon. Moreover, all observed variants in the
heterozygous amplicon are sorted in order of descending read depth (i.e.
the better supported allele is indicated first).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\overbrace{\overbrace{\text{c.[47C&gt;T;
152A&gt;T]/c.(=)}}^{1^{st}\text{ amplicon}} \text{;
}\underbrace{\text{c.323G&gt;A}}_{2^{nd}\text{
amplicon}}}^{\text{Nucleotide changes in coding region}} \equiv
\underbrace{\overbrace{\text{a16v|a N51I|N}}^{1^{st}\text{ amplicon}}
\underbrace{\text{ S108N}}_{2^{nd}\text{ amplicon}}}_{\text{Amino acid
changes}}
\]</span></p>
<p>In addition, as this genotype annotation could be confusing for
people outside of the area of molecular biology and genetics, and as the
presence of the resistant mutations does not directly indicate which
drug the genotype might be resistant to, a table that matches the
genotype and its likely phenotype is generated. In addition to showing
which drug the mutations confer resistance, the phenotype output of the
workflow also reports the number of resistance-associated mutations
observed. Additional, resistance-unrelated mutations are also indicated
by the phenotype output. Finally, the phenotype output also reports
whether any amplicons or genes involve missing information (unsuccessful
amplification).</p>
<p>The following scheme shows the annotated phenotype for the genotype
of the gene <span class="math inline">\(pfdhfr\)</span>
(PF3D7_0417200):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\overbrace{\text{a16v N51I C59C S108N I164I}}^{\text{Genotype}} \equiv
\overbrace{\text{a16v polymorphism in gene PF3D7_0417200 respect to
Reference Strain;} \atop \text{2 Pyrimethamine resistance-associated
mutations}}^{\text{Likely Phenotype}}
\]</span></p>
<p>As observed, the genotype contains 3 amino acid changes at positions
16, 51 and 108, the last two of which are associated to resistance to
Pyrimethamine in previous studies. In the next scheme is an example of a
genotype with missing data:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\overbrace{\underbrace{\text{a16? N51? C59?}}_{\text{Amplicon
PfDHFR_1}}\underbrace{\text{S108N I164I}}_{\text{Amplicon
PfDHFR_2}}}^{\text{Genotype}} \equiv \overbrace{\text{Amplicon(s)
PfDHFR_1 for gene PF3D7_0417200 did not amplify;} \atop \text{1
Pyrimethamine resistance mutation}}^{\text{Likely Phenotype}}
\]</span></p>
<p>Question marks (<code>?</code>) represent missing information in the
genotype, placed after the amino acid positions found to be polymorphic
in other samples of the tested population or in previous studies (as
indicated in the <code>reference_allele</code> table). If none of the
amplicons amplify for a specific gene, the phenotype annotation will
read as <code>Gene PF3D7_0417200 did not amplify</code>. To enhance
readability across different samples and genotypes, the genotype of each
sample is written taking into account all polymorphic positions in the
data set or in previous studies (as indicated in the
<code>reference_allele</code> table).</p>
<p>Information on individual (sample-level) amino acid polymorphism with
respect to the reference strain is shown in the next table for each gene
of interest:</p>

<h3>Haplotype frequency</h3>
<p>The haplotype is defined as the unique combination of alleles across
loci (variant sites across different amplicons) in a gene. In monoclonal
samples, the genotype is equivalent to the haplotype as only one allele
is observe at each locus.</p>
<p>For polyclonal samples, the complexity of infection (i.e., the number
of strains in the sample) is defined based on the maximum number of
alleles observed at any of the loci in the gene, and alleles in
heterozygous loci are sorted in descending order of read depth. The
order of the alleles in heterozygous loci is used to phase the

<p>When different amplicons within a gene each show multiple alleles,
and the number of alleles is different between these amplicons, the
major allele on the locus with fewest alleles is used to impute the
unknown/ambiguous haplotype(s) (haplotype with least read support).</p>

<p>Finally, haplotypes observed in monoclonal and polyclonal infections
have equal weights for calculating haplotype frequencies, so the
denominator is the total number of haplotypes counted instead of the
total number of infections.</p>
<p>The following table contains haplotype counts and frequencies (with
95% CI) for each category of Variable1 and Variable2:</p>

<h3>Drug phenotypes</h3>
<p>Resistance to a particular drug can be conferred by mutations in
multiple different genes, which is why in this section, instead of using
the gene as a unit of analysis we will use the drug of interest. In this
way, for each drug in each sample we will define the possible phenotype
based on the joint analysis of all the genes that have
resistance-associated mutations to that particular drug.</p>
<p>For example, in the case of pyrimethamine, 7 mutations associated
with resistance to this drug have been reported. Six of these mutations
are found in the <em>pfdhfr</em> gene and one in the <em>pfmdr2</em>
gene. Therefore, to define the possible phenotype of this drug, the
workflow will analyze the alleles present in each of these 7 positions
in the sample. It will also report other mutations that occur in either
of these two genes and whether amplification was unsuccessful for any of
the amplicons.</p>
<p>Therefore, when no mutations are found, the phenotype is defined as
follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{matrix}\overbrace{\text{a16v N51N C59C S108S
I164I}}^{\text{Genotype for gene} \atop \text{pfdhfr: PF3D7_0417200}} \\
\underbrace{\text{y479y T484T i492i}}_{\text{Genotype for gene} \atop
\text{pfmdr2: PF3D7_1447900}}\end{matrix} \implies
\overbrace{\text{Sensitive phenotype based on gene(s) } \\
\text{PF3D7_0417200 and PF3D7_1447900}}^{\text{Phenotype}}
\]</span></p>
<p>When at least one gene contains resistance-associated mutations or
mutations with respect to the reference, the defined phenotype is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{matrix}\overbrace{\text{a16v N51I C59C S108N
I164I}}^{\text{Genotype for gene} \atop \text{pfdhfr: PF3D7_0417200}} \\
\underbrace{\text{y479y T484T i492v}}_{\text{Genotype for gene} \atop
\text{pfmdr2: PF3D7_1447900}}\end{matrix} \implies \overbrace{\text{2
Pyrimethamine resistance mutations in gene PF3D7_0417200;} \\
\text{i492v polymorphism in gene PF3D7_1447900}}^{\text{Phenotype}}
\]</span></p>
<p>In the case of partial or unsuccessful amplification of any of the
genes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{matrix}\overbrace{\text{a16v N51I C59C S108?
I164?}}^{\text{Genotype for gene} \atop \text{pfdhfr: PF3D7_0417200}} \\
\underbrace{\text{y479? T484? i492?}}_{\text{Genotype for gene} \atop
\text{pfmdr2: PF3D7_1447900}}\end{matrix} \implies
\overbrace{\text{Partial haplotype: Amplicon(s) PfDHFR_2 for gene
PF3D7_0417200 did not amplify} \\ \text{and Gene PF3D7_1447900 did not
amplify}}^{\text{Phenotype}}
\]</span></p>

<p>For each drug the phenotypic profiles are classified into five
categories:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Sensitive Phenotype: All amplicons amplified and no mutations were
found with respect to the reference strain and the
<code>reference_allele</code> table.</li>
<li>Polymorphism(s) with respect to the reference strain: At least one
mutation with respect to the reference strain was found, but no
resistance-associated mutations occur. Partial haplotypes are also
included.</li>
<li>Mutation(s) associated with a resistant phenotype: At least one
resistance-associated mutations was found. Partial haplotypes are also
included.</li>
<li>Partial Haplotype: At least one amplicon has amplified and no
mutations occur.</li>
<li>Missing data: None of the amplicons amplified.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, the prevalence of these categories in the population
(defined by Variable1 and Variable2) is reported in the following
table:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>drug_resistant_haplotypes_plot$drug_phenotype_barplot$data %&gt;%
