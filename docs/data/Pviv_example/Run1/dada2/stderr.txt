Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> Fastq/116-GZ-Control_S6_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:

AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> Fastq/200-GZ-Control_S31_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Nextera	541	CTGTCTCTTATA	2732	19.80
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	2732	0.00
Illumina	0	AGATCGGAAGAGC	2732	0.00
Using Nextera adapter for trimming (count: 541). Second best hit was smallRNA (count: 0)

AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> Fastq/PF-27420-Alt-sWGA-Dilution_S75_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Nextera	61	CTGTCTCTTATA	63	96.83
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	63	0.00
Illumina	0	AGATCGGAAGAGC	63	0.00
Using Nextera adapter for trimming (count: 61). Second best hit was smallRNA (count: 0)
